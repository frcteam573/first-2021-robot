# FRC_573_2020_Robot
Team 573 2020 Robot Code Repository

This is the repo for FRC team 573's 2020 robot code. This will be a private repo until the end of the 2020 FRC season, so if anyone needs access talk to Coach Eric, who can grant them access.

We are going to try using Github for task managment this year as well. You'll see a few tasks, and milestones have always been created. We will create alot more once the season starts and assign them to each of you.

Remember the Team 573 Programming Help Docs can be found here.

And feel free to look at the 2019 and 2018 robot code for help as well.
